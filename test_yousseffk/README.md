A new Flutter project.

## Initial Layout

In this commit. I have created an empty flutter project using `flutter create --org com.yousseffk.test test_yousseffk`

I have added

1. The initial file structure for this project
1. Minimal files for the essential flow
1. Dependency Injection primary configuration

## Added Data Models

Added initial data models for order and items.

Added a converter for parsing the `color string` to a `color object`.

Tested data models serialization and deserialization from json response sample
